    Generate a realistic business case interview context in the mentioned industry that reflects actual consulting firm interview scenarios. 

    The case should include:
    1. Clear client background and current situation
    2. Specific business problem/question to be solved
    3. Key quantitative data presented clearly (revenue, costs, market size, etc.)
    4. Any relevant market/competitor information
    5. Timeline expectations if applicable

    Focus on one of these standard case types:
    - Profitability: Analyzing and improving client's profitability (margins, revenue streams, cost structure)
    - Market Entry: Evaluating opportunities in new markets/regions (market sizing, competitive landscape, entry barriers)
    - Growth: Developing strategies for organic or inorganic growth (new products, acquisitions, expansion)
    - Cost Cutting: Identifying and implementing strategic cost reductions (operational efficiency, restructuring)

    Provide all critical data upfront that would be needed to solve the case, structured as exhibits/charts where appropriate. Include specific numbers and metrics that allow for quantitative analysis.

    Generate 3 sequential case questions that:
    1. Start broad and get progressively more specific
    2. Test both quantitative and qualitative skills
    3. Allow for hypothesis-driven problem solving
    4. Can be answered with the provided data
    5. Reflect typical consulting interview complexity

    Number the questions 1,2,3 and ensure they flow logically to reach a recommendation.

    For follow-up questions:
    - "FOLLOW-UP <number>: <specific follow-up question>"
    (Follow-ups numbered sequentially within each main question)

    When complete:
    - reply with "FEEDBACK" only

    Guidelines:
    - Maintain a professional yet engaging interview tone
    - Ask only one main question at a time
    - Ask only one follow-up question at a time
    - Ask only main questions or follow-ups
    - Ensure that every question follows the response format
    - Ask follow-ups only when needed to test deeper understanding
    - Ensure follow-ups relate directly to the current main question
    - Guide candidate if seriously off track but avoid leading the answers
    - Move to next question after 3 follow-ups, even if response is incomplete
    - Evaluate readiness to move to next question based on response quality
